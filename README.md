# TIESA frontend

This repo contains React.js frontend for the control interface of the final product for TIESA. 

### Task list
There is a lot to do, as always. :D

- Switch to per-session targets instead of global list
- Change the ad-hoce state based navigation on datasets page to Router
- Fetch data from some backend instead of public folder (setup flask)
- After some remote fetching is done, add other functional page  besides datasets, that is able to receive streamed data from live simulation or treatment
